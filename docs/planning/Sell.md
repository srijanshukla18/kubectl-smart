kubectl-smart doesn't replace kubectl - it teaches you to use it better. Designed as
  "training wheels" for Junior SREs, it shows you the kubectl commands it runs, explains
  why each step matters, and gradually reduces hand-holding as you improve. Instead of
  hiding complexity behind abstractions, kubectl-smart reveals the debugging methodology
  that experienced SREs use, helping you build muscle memory and graduate to confident
  kubectl mastery while providing faster incident response for complex multi-resource
  correlations.
